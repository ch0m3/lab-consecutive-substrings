Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solution


FUNCTION consecutiveSubstrings(INPUT string)
    CREATE empty array called result

    FOR each index i from 0 to length of string - 1
        SET current substring to empty string

        FOR each index j from i to length of string - 1
            ADD character at position j of string to current substring
            ADD current substring to result array
        END FOR
    END FOR

    RETURN result
END FUNCTION




The outer loop picks a starting position

The inner loop builds substrings character by character

Each consecutive substring is pushed into the result array
